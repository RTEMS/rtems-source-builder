RTEMS Tools From Source
-----------------------

The RTEMS Source Builder is a tool to aid building packages from source used by
the RTEMS project. It helps consolidate the details you need to build a package
from source in a controlled and verifiable way. The tool is aimed at developers
of software who use tool sets for embedded type development and is not limited
to building just for RTEMS. Embedded development typically uses cross-compiling
tool chains, debuggers, and debugging aids. Together we call these a 'tool
set'. The RTEMS Source Builder is not limited to this role but designed to fit
with-in this specific niche. It can be used outside of the RTEMS project and we
welcome this happening in other open source or commercial projects.

The RTEMS Source Builder is typically used to build a set of tools or a 'build
set'. A 'build set' is a collection of packages and a package is a specific
tool, for example gcc or gdb. The RTEMS Source Builder attempts to support any
host environment that runs Python and you can build the package on. It is not
some sort of magic that can take any piece of source code and make it
build. Someone at some point in time has figured out how to build that package
from source and taught this tool. The RTEMS Source Builder has been tested on:

[[platform_links]]
* <<_archlinux,Archlinux>>
* <<_centos,Centos>>
* <<_fedora,Fedora>>
* <<_freebsd,FreeBSD>>
* <<_netbsd,NetBSD>>
* <<_macos,MacOS>>
* <<_mint,Linux Mint>>
* <<_opensuse,openSUSE>>
* <<_raspbian,Raspbian>>
* <<_ubuntu,Ubuntu>>
* <<_windows,Windows>>
* <<_ubuntu,Xubuntu>>

The RTEMS Source Builder has two types of configuration data. The first is the
'build set'. A _build set_ describes a collection of packages that define a set
of tools you would use when developing software for RTEMS. For example the
basic GNU tool set is binutils, gcc, and gdb and is the typical base suite of
tools you need for an embedded cross-development type project. The second type
of configuration data is the configuration files and they define how a package
is built. Configuration files are scripts loosely based on the RPM spec file
format and they detail the steps needed to build a package. The steps are
'preparation', 'building', and 'installing'. Scripts support macros, shell
expansion, logic, includes plus many more features useful when build packages.

The RTEMS Source Builder does not interact with any host package management
systems. There is no automatic dependence checking between various packages you
build or packages and software your host system you may have installed. We
assume the build sets and configuration files you are using have been created
by developers who do. Support is provided for package config or pkgconfg type
files so you can check and use standard libraries if present. If you have a
problem please ask on the RTEMS Users mailing list.

This documentation caters for a range of users from new to experienced RTEMS
developers. New users can follow the Quick Start section up to the "Installing
and Tar Files" to get a working tools and RTEMS. Users building a binary tool
set for release can read the "Installing and Tar Files". Users wanting to run
and test bleeding edge tools or packages, or wanting update or extend the RSB's
configuration can read the remaining sections.

*************************************************************
IMPORTANT: If you have a problem please see <<_bugs,the reporting bugs>>
           section.
*************************************************************

Quick Start
-----------

The quick start will show you how to build a set of RTEMS tools for a supported
architecture. The tools are installed into a build _prefix_. The _prefix_ is the
top of a group of directories containing all the files needed to develop RTEMS
applications. Building an RTEMS build set will build all that you need. This
includes autoconf, automake, assemblers, linkers, compilers, debuggers,
standard libraries and RTEMS itself.

There is no need to become root or the administrator and we recommend you avoid
doing this. You can build and install the tools anywhere on the host's file
system you, as a standard user, have read and write access too. I recommend you
use your home directory and work under the directory `~/development/rtems`. The
examples shown here will do this.

You can use the build _prefix_ to install and maintain different versions of
the tools. Doing this lets you try a new set of tools while not touching your
proven working production set of tools. Once you have proven the new tools are
working rebuild with the 'production' prefix switching your development to them.

I also suggest you keep your environment to the bare minimum, particularly the
path variable. Using environment variables has been proven over the years to be
difficult to manage in production systems.

.Host Setup
*************************************************************
IMPORTANT: Before proceeding to the next section please refer to the
<<_host_setups,host specific setup>> for your host and install any extra
packages. The RSB assumes the needed packages are installed and work.
*************************************************************

.Path to use when building applications
*************************************************************
TIP: Do not forget to do this before you use the tools such as build RTEMS.

The RSB by default will install (copy) the executables under the prefix you
supply. To use the tools once finished just set your path to the 'bin'
directory under the _prefix_ you use. In the examples that follow the _prefix_
is `$HOME/development/rtems/4.11` and is set using the `--prefix` option so the
path you need to configure to build applications can be set with the following
in a BASH shell:

-------------------------------------------------------------
$ export PATH=$HOME/development/rtems/4.11/bin:$PATH
-------------------------------------------------------------
Make sure you place the RTEMS tool path at the front of your path so they are
searched first. RTEMS can provide newer versions of some tools your operating
system provides and placing the RTEMS tools path at the front means it is
searched first and the RTEMS needed versions of the tools are used.
*************************************************************

Setup
~~~~~

Setup a development work space:

-------------------------------------------------------------
$ cd
$ mkdir -p development/rtems/src
$ cd development/rtems/src
-------------------------------------------------------------

The RTEMS Source Builder is distributed as source. It is Python code so all you
need to do is head over to the RTEMS GIT repository and clone the code directly
from git:

-------------------------------------------------------------
$ git clone git://git.rtems.org/rtems-source-builder.git
$ cd rtems-source-builder
-------------------------------------------------------------

Checking
~~~~~~~~

The next step is to check if your host is set up correctly. The RTEMS Source
Builder provides a tool to help:

-------------------------------------------------------------
$ source-builder/sb-check
warning: exe: absolute exe found in path: (__objcopy) /usr/local/bin/objcopy <1>
warning: exe: absolute exe found in path: (__objdump) /usr/local/bin/objdump
error: exe: not found: (_xz) /usr/local/bin/xz <2>
RTEMS Source Builder environment is not correctly set up
$ source-builder/sb-check
RTEMS Source Builder environment is ok <3>
-------------------------------------------------------------

<1> A tool is in the environment path but does not match the expected path.
<2> The executable 'xz' is not found.
<3> The host's environment is set up correct.

The checking tool will output a list of executable files not found if problems
are detected. Locate those executable files and install them. You may also be
given a list of warnings about executable files not in the expected location
however the executable was located somewhere in your environment's path. You
will need to check each tool to determine if this is an issue. An executable
not in the standard location may indicate it is not the host operating system's
standard tool. It maybe ok or it could be buggy, only you can determine this.

The <<_host_setups,Host Setups>> section lists packages you should install for
common host operating systems. It maybe worth checking if you have those
installed.

Build Sets
~~~~~~~~~~

The RTEMS tools can be built within the RTEMS Source Builder's source tree. We
recommend you do this so lets change into the RTEMS directory in the RTEMS
Source Builder package:

-------------------------------------------------------------
$ cd rtems
-------------------------------------------------------------

If you are unsure how to specify the build set for the architecture you wish to
build ask the tool:

-------------------------------------------------------------

    are welcome to try them but you must remember they are unstable, can change
    at any point in time and your application may not work. If you have an
    issue with a production tool it may pay to try the unstable tool to see if
    it has been resolved.

Building

In this quick start I will build a SPARC tool set.

<1> Providing a log file redirects the build output into a file. Logging the
    build output provides a simple way to report problems.
<2> The prefix is the location on your file system the tools are installed
    into. Provide a prefix to a location you have read and write access. You
    can use the prefix to install different versions or builds of tools. Just
    use the path to the tools you want to use when building RTEMS.
<3> The build set. This is the SPARC build set. First a specifically referenced
    file is checked for and if not found the '%{_configdir} path is
    searched. The set builder will first look for files with a +.bset+
    extension and then for a configuration file with a +.cfg+ extension.
<4> The SPARC build set first builds the expat library as it is used in GDB.
    This is the expat configuration used.
<5> The binutils build configuration.
<6> The GCC and Newlib build configuration.
<7> The GDB build configuration.
<8> Installing the built packages to the install prefix.
<9> All the packages built are cleaned at the end. If the build fails all the
    needed files are present. You may have to clean up by deleting the build
    directory if the build fails.
<10> The time to build the package. This lets you see how different host
     hardware or configurations perform.

Your SPARC RTEMS 4.11 tool set will be installed and ready to build RTEMS and
RTEMS applications. When the build runs you will notice the tool fetch the
source code from the internet. These files are cached in a directory called
+source+. If you run the build again the cached files are used. This is what
happened in the shown example before.

TIP: The RSB for releases will automatically build and install RTEMS. The
development version require adding +--with-rtems+. Use this for a single
command to get the tools and RTEMS with one command.

<1> The target the compiler is built for.
<2> The configure options used to build GCC.
<3> The threading model is always RTEMS. This makes the RTEMS tools difficult
    for bare metal development more difficult.
<4> The version string. It contains the Git hash of the RTEMS Source Builder
    you are using. If your local clone has been modifed that state is also
    recorded in the version string. The hash allows you to track from a GCC
    executable back to the original source used to build it.

NOTE: The RTEMS thread model enables specific hooks in GCC so applications
built with RTEMS tools need the RTEMS runtime to operate correctly. You can use
RTEMS tools to build bare metal component but it is more difficult than with a
bare metal tool chain and you need to know what you are doing at a low
level. The RTEMS Source Builder can build bare metal tool chains as well. Look
in the top level +bare+ directory.

Distributing and Archiving A Build
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you wish to create and distribute your build or you want to archive a build
you can create a tar file. This is a more advanced method for binary packaging
and installing of tools.

By default the RTEMS Source Builder installs the built packages directly and
optionally it can also create a _build set tar file_ or a _package tar file_
per package built. The normal and default behaviour is to let the RTEMS Source
Builder install the tools. The source will be downloaded, built, installed and
cleaned up.

The tar files are created with the full build prefix present and if you follow
the examples given in this documentation the path is absolute. This can cause
problems if you are installing on a host you do not have super user or
administrator rights on because the prefix path may references part you do not
have write access too and tar will not extract the files. You can use the
+--strip-components+ option in tar if your host tar application supports it to
remove the parts you do not have write access too or you may need to unpack the
tar file somewhere and copy the file tree from the level you have write access
from. Embedding the full prefix path in the tar files lets you know what the
prefix is and is recommended. For example if
`/home/chris/development/rtems/4.11` is the prefix used you cannot change
directory to the root (`/`) and install because the `/home` is root access
only. To install you would:

-------------------------------------------------------------
$ cd
$ tar --strip-components=3 -xjf rtems-4.11-sparc-rtems4.11-1.tar.bz2
-------------------------------------------------------------

A build set tar file is created by adding `--bset-tar-file` option to the
`sb-set-builder` command.

Controlling the Build
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Build sets can be controlled via the command line to enable and disable various
features. There is no definitive list of build options that can be listed
because they are implemented with the configuration scripts. The best way to
find what is available is to grep the configuration files. for +with+ and
+without+.

Following are currentlt available:

'--without-rtems':: Do not build RTEMS when building an RTEMS build set.
'--without-cxx':: Do not build a C++ compiler.
'--with-objc':: Attempt to build a C++ compiler.
'--with-fortran':: Attempt to build a Fortran compiler.

Why Build from Source ?
-----------------------

The RTEMS Source Builder is not a replacement for the binary install systems
you have with commercial operating systems or open source operating system
distributions. Those products and distributions are critically important and
are the base that allows the Source Builder to work. The RTEMS Source Builder
sits somewhere between you manually entering the commands to build a tool set
and a tool such as +yum+ or +apt-get+ to install binary packages made
specifically for your host operating system. Building manually or installing a
binary package from a remote repository are valid and real alternatives while
the Source Builder is attempting to provide a specific service of repeatably
being able to build tool sets from source code.

If you are developing a system or product that has a long shelf life or is used
in a critical piece of infrastructure that has a long life cycle being able to
build from source is important. It insulates the project from the fast ever
changing world of the host development machines. If your tool set is binary and
you have lost the ability to build it you have lost a degree of control and
flexibility open source gives you. Fast moving host environments are
fantastic. We have powerful multi-core computers with huge amounts of memory
and state of the art operating systems to run on them however the product or
project you are part of may need to be maintained well past the life time of
these host. Being able to build from source an important and critical part of
this process because you can move to a newer host and create an equivalent tool
set.

Building from source provides you with control over the configuration of the
package you are building. If all or the most important dependent parts are
built from source you limit the exposure to host variations. For example the
GNU C compiler (gcc) currently uses a number of 3rd party libraries internally
(gmp, mpfr, etc). If your validated compiler generating code for your target
processor is dynamically linked against the host's version of these libraries
any change in the host's configuration may effect you. The changes the host's
package management system makes may be perfectly reasonable in relation to the
distribution being managed however this may not extend to you and your
tools. Building your tools from source and controlling the specific version of
these dependent parts means you are not exposing yourself to unexpected and
often difficult to resolve problems. On the other side you need to make sure
your tools build and work with newer versions of the host operating
system. Given the stability of standards based libraries like 'libc' and ever
improving support for standard header file locations this task is becoming
easier.

The RTEMS Source Builder is designed to be audited and incorporated into a
project's verification and validation process. If your project is developing
critical applications that needs to be traced from source to executable code in
the target, you need to also consider the tools and how to track them.

If your IT department maintains all your computers and you do not have suitable
rights to install binary packages, building from source lets you create your
own tool set that you install under your home directory. Avoiding installing
any extra packages as a super user is always helpful in maintaining a secure
computing environment.

[[_bugs]]
Bugs, Crashes, and Build Failures
---------------------------------

The RTEMS Source Builder is a Python program and every care is taken to test
the code however bugs, crashes, and build failures can and do happen. If you
find a bug please report it via the RTEMS Bug tracker tool Bugzilla or via
email on the RTEMS Users list. RTEMS's bugzilla is found at
https://www.rtems.org/bugzilla/.

Please include the generated RSB report. If you see the following a report has
been generated:

-------------------------------------------------------------
 ...
 ...
Build FAILED <1>
  See error report: rsb-report-4.11-rtems-lm32.txt <2>
-------------------------------------------------------------
<1> The build has failed.
<2> The report's file name.

The generated report contains the command line, version of the RSB, your host's
+uname+ details, the version of Python and the last 200 lines of the log.

If for some reason there is no report please send please report the following:

. Command line,
. The git hash,
. Host details with the output of the +uname -a+ command,
. If you have made any modifications.

If there is a Python crash please cut and paste the Python backtrace into the
bug report. If the tools fail to build please locate the first error in the log
file. This can be difficult to find on hosts with many cores so it sometimes
pays to re-run the command with the +--jobs=none+ option to get a log that is
correctly sequenced. If searching the log file seach for +error:+ and the error
should be just above it.

[[_contributing]]
Contributing
------------

We welcome all users adding, fixing, updating and upgrading packages and their
configurations. The RSB is open source and open to contributions. These can be
bug fixes, new features or new configurations. Please break patches down into
changes to the core Python code, configuration changes or new configurations.

Please email me patches via git so I can maintain your commit messages so you
are acknowledged as the contributor.

Most of what follows is related to the development of RSB and it's
configurations.

Project Sets
------------

The RTEMS Source Builder supports project configurations. Project
configurations can be public or private and can be contained in the RTEMS
Source Builder project if suitable, other projects they use the RTEM Source
Builder or privately on your local file system.

The configuration file loader searches the macro +_configdir+ and by default
this is set to +%{\_topdir}/config:%{\_sbdir}/config+ where +_topdir+ is the
your current working direct, in other words the directory you invoke the RTEMS
Source Builder command in, and +_sbdir+ is the directory where the RTEMS Source
Builder command resides. Therefore the +config+ directory under each of these
is searched so all you need to do is create a +config+ in your project and add
your configuration files. They do not need to be under the RTEMS Source Builder
source tree. Public projects are included in the main RTEMS Source Builder such
as RTEMS.

You can also add your own +patches+ directory next to your +config+ directory
as the +%patch+ command searches the +_patchdir+ macro variable and it is
by default set to +%{\_topdir}/patches:%{\_sbdir}/patches+.

The +source-builder/config+ directory provides generic scripts for building
various tools. You can specialise these in your private configurations to make
use of them. If you add new generic configurations please contribute them back
to the project

Bare Metal
~~~~~~~~~~

The RSB contains a 'bare' configuration tree and you can use this to add
packages you use on the hosts. For example 'qemu' is supported on a range of
hosts. RTEMS tools live in the +rtems/config+ directory tree. RTEMS packages
include tools for use on your host computer as well as packages you can build
and run on RTEMS.

The 'bare metal' support for GNU Tool chains. An example is the 'lang/gcc491'
build set. You need to provide a target via the command line '--target'
option and this is in the standard 2 or 3 tuple form. For example for an ARM
compiler you would use 'arm-eabi' or 'arm-eabihf', and for SPARC you would
use 'sparc-elf'.

RTEMS
~~~~~

The RTEMS Configurations found in the 'rtems' directory. The configurations are
grouped by RTEMS version. In RTEMS the tools are specific to a specific version
because of variations between Newlib and RTEMS. Restructuring in RTEMS and
Newlib sometimes moves _libc_ functionality between these two parts and this
makes existing tools incompatible with RTEMS.

RTEMS allows architectures to have different tool versions and patches. The
large number of architectures RTEMS supports can make it difficult to get a
common stable version of all the packages. An architecture may require a recent
GCC because an existing bug has been fixed, however the more recent version may
have a bug in other architecture. Architecture specific patches should be
limited to the architecture it relates to. The patch may fix a problem on the
effect architecture however it could introduce a problem in another
architecture. Limit exposure limits any possible crosstalk between
architectures.

RTEMS supports _stable_ and _unstable_. Stable configurations are fixed while
unstable configurations are supporting using snapshots of user macros and
reference release candidates or source extracted directly from version
control. The stable build sets are referenced as +<version>/rtems-<arch>+ and
include `autoconf` and `automake`.

If you are building a released version of RTEMS the release RTEMS tar file will
be downloaded and built as part of the build process. If you are building a
tool set for use with the development branch of RTEMS, the development branch
will be cloned directly from the RTEMS GIT repository and built.

When building RTEMS within the RTEMS Source Builder it needs a suitable working
`autoconf` and `automake`. These packages need to built and installed in their
prefix in order for them to work. The RTEMS Source Builder installs all
packages only after they have been built so if you host does not have a
recent enough version of `autoconf` and `automake` you first need to build them
and install them then build your tool set. The commands are:

-------------------------------------------------------------
$ ../source-builder/sb-set-builder --log=l-4.11-at.txt \
   --prefix=$HOME/development/rtems/4.11 4.11/rtems-autotools
$ export PATH=~/development/rtems/4.11/bin:$PATH <1>
$ ../source-builder/sb-set-builder --log=l-4.11-sparc.txt \
   --prefix=$HOME/development/rtems/4.11 4.11/rtems-sparc
-------------------------------------------------------------
<1> Setting the path.

TIP: If this is your first time building the tools and RTEMS it pays to add the
`--dry-run` option. This will run through all the configuration files and if
any checks fail you will see this quickly rather than waiting for until the
build fails a check.

To build snapshots for testing purposes you use the available macro maps
passing them on the command line using the `--macros` option. For RTEMS these
are held in `config/snapshots` directory. The following builds _newlib_ from
CVS:

-------------------------------------------------------------
$ ../source-builder/sb-set-builder --log=l-4.11-sparc.txt \
   --prefix=$HOME/development/rtems/4.11 \
   --macros=snapshots/newlib-head.mc \
   4.11/rtems-sparc
-------------------------------------------------------------

and the following uses the version control heads for _binutils_, _gcc_,
_newlib_, _gdb_ and _RTEMS_:

-------------------------------------------------------------
$ ../source-builder/sb-set-builder --log=l-heads-sparc.txt \
   --prefix=$HOME/development/rtems/4.11-head \
   --macros=snapshots/binutils-gcc-newlib-gdb-head.mc \
   4.11/rtems-sparc
-------------------------------------------------------------

Patches
~~~~~~~

Packages being built by the RSB need patches from time to time and the RSB
supports patching upstream packages. The patches are held in a seperate
directory called +patches+ relative to the configuration directory you are
building. For example +%{\_topdir}/patches:%{\_sbdir}/patches+. Patches are
declared in the configuraiton files in a similar manner to the package's source
so please refer to the +%source+ documentation. Patches, like the source, are
to be made publically available for configurations that live in the RSB package
and are downloaded on demand.

If a package has a patch management tool it is recommended you reference the
package's patch management tools directly. If the RSB does not support the
specific patch manage tool please contact the mailing list to see if support
can be added.

Patches for packages developed by the RTEMS project can be placed in the RTEMS
Tools Git repository. The +tools+ directory in the repository has various
places a patch can live. The tree is broken down in RTEMS releases and then
tools within that release. If the package is not specific to any release the
patch can be added closer to the top under the package's name. Patches to fix
specific tool related issues for a specific architecture should be grouped
under the specific architecture and only applied when building that
architecture avoiding a patch breaking an uneffected architecture.

Patches in the RTEMS Tools repository need to be submitted to the upstream
project. It should not be a clearing house for patches that will not be
accepted upstream.

Patches are added to a component's name and in the +%prep:+ section the patches
can be set up, meaning they are applied to source. The patches are applied in
the order they are added. If there is a dependency make sure you order the
patches correctly when you add them. You can add any number of patches and the
RSB will handle them efficently.

Patches can have options. These are added before the patch URL. If no options
are provided the patch's setup default options are used.

Patches can be declared in build set up files.

This examples shows how to declare a patch for gdb in the +lm32+ architecture:

-------------------------------------------------------------
%patch add <1> gdb <2> %{rtems_gdb_patches}/lm32/gdb-sim-lm32uart.diff <3>
-------------------------------------------------------------
<1> The patch's +add+ command.
<2> The group of patches this patch belongs too.
<3> The patch's URL. It is downloaded from here.

Patches require a checksum to avoid a warning. The +%hash+ directive can be
used to add a checksum for a patch that is used to verify the patch:

-------------------------------------------------------------
%hash md5 <1> gdb-sim-lm32uart.diff <2> 77d070878112783292461bd6e7db17fb <3>
-------------------------------------------------------------
<1> The type of checksum, in the case an MD5 hash.
<2> The patch file the checksum is for.
<3> The MD5 hash.

The patches are applied when a patch +setup+ command is issued in the +%prep:+
section. All patches in the group are applied. To apply the GDB patch above
use:

-------------------------------------------------------------
%patch setup <1> gdb <2> -p1 <3>
-------------------------------------------------------------
<1> The patch's +setup+ command.
<2> The group of patches to apply.
<3> The patch group's default options. If no option is given with the patch
these options are used.

Architecture specific patches live in the architecture build set file isolating
the patch to that specific architecture. If a patch is common to a tool it
resides in the RTEMS tools configuration file. Do not place patches for tools
in the +source-builder/config+ template configuration files.

To test a patch simply copy it to your local +patches+ directory. The RSB will
see the patch is present and will not attempt to download it. Once you are
happy with the patch submit it to the project and a core developer will review
it and add it to the RTEMS Tools git repository.

Cross and Canadian Cross Building
---------------------------------

Cross building and Canadian Cross building is the process of building on one
machine an executable that runs on another machine. An example is building a
set of RTEMS tools on Linux to run on Windows. The RSB supports cross building
and Canadian cross building.

This sections details how to the RSB to cross and Canadian cross build.

Cross Building
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Cross building is where the _build_ machine and _host_ are different. The
_build_ machine runs the RSB and the _host_ machine is where the output from
the build runs. An example is building a package such as NTP for RTEMS on your
development machine.

To build the NTP package for RTEMS you enter the RSB command:

-------------------------------------------------------------
$ ../source-builder/sb-set-builder \
   --log=log_ntp_arm.txt \
   --prefix=$HOME/development/rtems/4.11 <1> \
   --host=arm-rtems4.11 <2> \
   --with-rtems-bsp=xilinx_zynq_zc706 <3> \
   4.11/net/ntp
-------------------------------------------------------------
<1> The tools and the RTEMS BSP are installed under the same prefix.
<2> The +--host+ command is the RTEMS architecture and version.
<3> The BSP is built and installed in the prefix. The arhcitecture must
    match the +--host+ architecture.

TIP: If you install BSPs into a different path to the prefix use the
+--with-tools+ option to specify the path to the tools. Do not add the 'bin'
directory at the end of the path.

Canadian Cross Building
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A Canadian cross builds are where the _build_, _host_ and _target_ machines all
differ. For example building an RTEMS compiler for an ARM processor that runs
on Windows is built using a Linux machine. The process is controlled by setting
the build triplet to the host you are building, the host triplet to the host
the tools will run on and the target to the RTEMS architecture you require. The
tools needed by the RSB are:

. Build host C and C++ compiler
. Host C and C++ cross compiler

The RTEMS Source Builder requires you provide the build host C and C\++
compiler and the final host C and C\++ cross-compiler. The RSB will build the
build host RTEMS compiler and the final host RTEMS C and C++ compiler, the
output of this process.

The Host C and C++ compiler is a cross-compiler that builds executables for
the host you want the tools for. You need to provide these tools. For Windows a
number of Unix operating systems provide MinGW tool sets as packages.

The RSB will build an RTEMS tool set for the build host. This is needed when
building the final host's RTEMS compiler as it needs to build RTEMS runtime
code such as _libc_ on the build host.

TIP: Make sure the host's cross-compiler tools are in your path before run the
RSB build command.

TIP: Canadian Cross built tools will not run on the machine being used to build
them so you should provide the +--bset-tar-files+ and +--no-install+
options. The option to not install the files lets you provide a prefix that
does not exist or you cannot access.

To perform a cross build add +--host=+ to the command line. For example to
build a MinGW tool set on FreeBSD for Windows add +--host=mingw32+ if the cross
compiler is +mingw32-gcc+:

-------------------------------------------------------------
$ ../source-builder/sb-set-builder --host=mingw32 \
   --log=l-mingw32-4.11-sparc.txt \
   --prefix=$HOME/development/rtems/4.11 \
   4.11/rtems-sparc
-------------------------------------------------------------

If you are on a Linux Fedora build host with the MinGW packages installed the
command line is:

-------------------------------------------------------------
$ ../source-builder/sb-set-builder --host=i686-w64-mingw32 \
   --log=l-mingw32-4.11-sparc.txt \
   --prefix=$HOME/development/rtems/4.11 \
   4.11/rtems-sparc
-------------------------------------------------------------

RTEMS 3rd Party Packages
------------------------

This section describes how to build and add an RTEMS 3rd party package to the
RSB.

A 3rd party package is a library or software package built to run on RTEMS,
examples are NTP, Net-Snmp, libjpeg or Python. These pieces of software can be
used to help build RTEMS applications. The package is built for a specific
BSP and so requires a working RTEMS tool chain and an installed RTEMS Board
Support Package (BSP).

The RSB support for building 3rd part packages is based around the pkconfig
files (PC) installed with the BSP. The pkgconfig support in RTEMS is considered
experimental and can have some issues for some BSPs. This issue is rooted deep
in the RTEMS build system. If you have any issues with this support please ask
on the RTEMS developers mailing list.

Building
~~~~~~~~

To build a package you need to have a suitable RTEMS tool chain and RTEMS BSP
installed. The set builder command line requires you provide the tools path,
the RTEMS host, and the prefix path to the installed RTEMS BSP. The prefix
needs to be the same as the prefix used to build RTEMS.

To build Net-SNMP the command is:

-------------------------------------------------------------
cd rtems-source-builder/rtems
$ ../source-builder/sb-set-builder --log=log_sis_net_snmp \
    --prefix=$HOME/development/rtems/bsps/4.11 \
    --with-tools=$HOME/development/rtems/4.11 \

-------------------------------------------------------------

Adding
~~~~~~

Adding a package requires you first build it manually by downloading the source
for the package and building it for RTEMS using the command line of a standard
shell. If the package has not been ported to RTEMS you will need to port it and
this may require you asking questions on the package's user or development
support lists as well as RTEMS's developers list. Your porting effort may end
up with a patch. RTEMS requires a patch be submitted upstream to the project's
community as well as RTEMS so it can be added to the RTEMS Tools git
repository. A patch in the RTEMS Tools git reposiitory can then be referenced
by an RSB configuration file.

A package may create executables, for example NTP normally creates executables
such as +ntdp+, +ntpupdate+, or +ntpdc+. These executables can be useful when
testing the package however they are of limited use by RTEMS users because they
cannot be directly linked into a user application. Users need to link to the
functions in these executables or even the executable as a function placed in
libraries. If the package does not export the code in a suitable manner please
contact the project's commuinity and see if you can work them to provide a way
for the code to be exported. This may be difficult because exporting internal
headers and functions opens the project up to API compatibility issues they did
not have before. In the simplest case attempting to get the code into a static
library with a single call entry point exported in a header would give RTEMS
user's access to the package's main functionality.

A package requires 3 files to be created:

. The first file is the RTEMS build set file and it resides in the
  +$$rtems/config/%{rtems_version}$$+ path in a directory tree based on the
  FreeBSD ports collection. For the NTP package and RTEMS 4.11 this is
  +rtems/config/4.11/net/ntp.bset+. If you do not know the FreeBSD port path
  for the package you are adding please ask. The build set file references a
  specific configuration file therefore linking the RTEMS version to a specific
  version of the package you are adding. Updating the package to a new version
  requires changing the build set to the new configuration file.

. The second file is an RTEMS version specific configuration file and it
  includes the RSB RTEMS BSP support. These configuration files reside in the
  +rtems/config+ tree again under the FreeBSP port's path name. For example the
  NTP package is found in the +net+ directory of the FreeBSD ports tree so the
  NTP configuration path is +$$rtems/config/net/ntp-4.2.6p5-1.cfg$$+ for that
  specific version. The configuration file name typically provides version
  specific references and the RTEMS build set file references a specific
  version. This configuration file references the build configuration file held
  in the common configuration file tree.

. The build configuration. This is a common script that builds the package. It
  resides in the +source-builder/config+ directory and typically has the
  packages's name with the major version number. If the build script does not
  change for each major version number a _common_ base script can be created
  and included by each major version configuration script. The _gcc_ compiler
  configuration is an example. This approach lets you branch a version if
  something changes that is not backwards compatible. It is important to keep
  existing versions building. The build configuration should be able to build a
  package for the build host as well as RTEMS as the RSB abstracts the RTEMS
  specific parts. See <<H1,+_Configuration_+>> for more details.

BSP Support
~~~~~~~~~~~

The RSB provides support to help build packages for RTEMS. RTEMS applications
can be viewed as statically linked executables operating in a single address
space. As a result only the static libraries a package builds are required and
these libraries need to be ABI compatible with the RTEMS kernel and application
code meaning compiler ABI flags cannot be mixed when building code. The 3rd
party package need to use the same compiler flags as the BSP used to build
RTEMS.

[TIP]
=============================================================

RTEMS's dynamic loading support does not use the standard shared library
support found in Unix and the ELF standard. RTEMS's loader uses static
libraries and the runtime link editor performs a similar function to a host
based static linker. RTEMS will only reference static libraries even if dynamic
libraries are created and installed.

=============================================================

The RSB provides the configuration file +rtems/config/rtems-bsp.cfg+ to support
building 3rd party packages and you need to include this file in your RTEMS
version specific configuration file. For example the Net-SNMP configuration
file:

.rtems/config/net-mgmt/net-snmp-5.7.2.1-1.cfg
-------------------------------------------------------------
#
# NetSNMP 5.7.2.1
#

%if %{release} == %{nil}
 %define release 1 <1>
%endif

%include %{_configdir}/rtems-bsp.cfg <2>

#
# NetSNMP Version
#
%define net_snmp_version 5.7.2.1 <3>

#
# We need some special flags to build this version.
#
%define net_snmp_cflags <4> -DNETSNMP_CAN_USE_SYSCTL=1 -DARP_SCAN_FOUR_ARGUMENTS=1 -DINP_IPV6=0

#
# Patch for RTEMS support.
#
%patch add net-snmp %{rtems_git_tools}/net-snmp/rtems-net-snmp-5.7.2.1-20140623.patch <5>

#
# NetSNMP Build configuration
#
%include %{_configdir}/net-snmp-5-1.cfg <6>
-------------------------------------------------------------
<1> The release number.
<2> Include the RSB RTEMS BSP support.
<3> The Net-SNMP package's version.
<4> Add specific CFLAGS to the build process. See the +net-snmp-5.7.2.1-1.cfg+
    for details.
<5> The RTEMS Net-SNMP patch downloaded from the RTEMS Tools git repo.
<6> The Net-SNMP standard build configuration.

The RSB RTEMS BSP support file +rtems/config/rtems-bsp.cfg+ checks to make sure
standard command line options are provided. These include `--host` and
`--with-rtems-bsp`. If the `--with-tools` command line option is not given the
+${\_prefix}+ is used.

.rtems/config/rtems-bsp.cfg
-------------------------------------------------------------
%if %{_host} == %{nil} <1>
 %error No RTEMS target specified: --host=host
%endif

%ifn %{defined with_rtems_bsp} <2>
 %error No RTEMS BSP specified: --with-rtems-bsp=bsp
%endif

%ifn %{defined with_tools} <3>
 %define with_tools %{_prefix}
%endif

#
# Set the path to the tools.
#
%{path prepend %{with_tools}/bin} <4>
-------------------------------------------------------------
<1> Check the host has been set.
<2> Check a BSP has been specified.
<3> If no tools path has been provided assume they are under the %{\_prefix}.
<4> Add the tools +bin+ path to the system path.

RTEMS exports the build flags used in pkgconfig (.pc) files and the RSB can
read and manage them even when there is no pkgconfig support installed on your
build machine. Using this support we can obtain a BSP's configuration and set
some standard macros variables:

.rtems/config/rtems-bsp.cfg
-------------------------------------------------------------
%{pkgconfig prefix %{_prefix}/lib/pkgconfig} <1>
%{pkgconfig crosscompile yes} <2>
%{pkgconfig filter-flags yes} <3>

#
# The RTEMS BSP Flags
#
%define rtems_bsp           %{with_rtems_bsp}
%define rtems_bsp_ccflags   %{pkgconfig ccflags %{_host}-%{rtems_bsp}} <4>
%define rtems_bsp_cflags    %{pkgconfig cflags  %{_host}-%{rtems_bsp}}
%define rtems_bsp_ldflags   %{pkgconfig ldflags %{_host}-%{rtems_bsp}}
%define rtems_bsp_libs      %{pkgconfig libs    %{_host}-%{rtems_bsp}}
-------------------------------------------------------------
<1> Set the path to the BSP's pkgconfig file.
<2> Let pkgconfig know this is a cross-compile build.
<3> Filter flags such as warnings. Warning flags are specific to a package.
<4> Ask pkgconfig for the various items we require.

The flags obtain by pkgconfig and given a `rtems_bsp_` prefix and we uses these
to set the RSB host support CFLAGS, LDFLAGS and LIBS flags. When we build a 3rd
party library your host computer is the _build_ machine and RTEMS is the _host_
machine therefore we set the `host` variables:

.rtems/config/rtems-bsp.cfg
-------------------------------------------------------------
%define host_cflags  %{rtems_bsp_cflags}
%define host_ldflags %{rtems_bsp_ldflags}
%define host_libs    %{rtems_bsp_libs}
-------------------------------------------------------------

Finally we provide all the paths you may require when configuring a
package. Packages by default consider the `_prefix` the base and install
various files under this tree. The package you are building is specific to a
BSP and so needs to install into the specific BSP path under the
`_prefix`. This allows more than BSP build of this package to be install under
the same `_prefix` at the same time:

.rtems/config/rtems-bsp.cfg
-------------------------------------------------------------
%define rtems_bsp_prefix  %{_prefix}/%{_host}/%{rtems_bsp} <1>
%define _exec_prefix      %{rtems_bsp_prefix}
%define _bindir           %{_exec_prefix}/bin
%define _sbindir          %{_exec_prefix}/sbin
%define _libexecdir       %{_exec_prefix}/libexec
%define _datarootdir      %{_exec_prefix}/share
%define _datadir          %{_datarootdir}
%define _sysconfdir       %{_exec_prefix}/etc
%define _sharedstatedir   %{_exec_prefix}/com
%define _localstatedir    %{_exec_prefix}/var
%define _includedir       %{_libdir}/include
%define _lib              lib
%define _libdir           %{_exec_prefix}/%{_lib}
%define _libexecdir       %{_exec_prefix}/libexec
%define _mandir           %{_datarootdir}/man
%define _infodir          %{_datarootdir}/info
%define _localedir        %{_datarootdir}/locale
%define _localedir        %{_datadir}/locale
%define _localstatedir    %{_exec_prefix}/var
-------------------------------------------------------------
<1> The path to the BSP.

When you configure a package you can reference these paths and the RSB will
provide sensible default or in this case map them to the BSP:

.source-builder/config/ntp-4-1.cfg
-------------------------------------------------------------
  ../${source_dir_ntp}/configure \ <1>
    --host=%{_host} \
    --prefix=%{_prefix} \
    --bindir=%{_bindir} \
    --exec_prefix=%{_exec_prefix} \
    --includedir=%{_includedir} \
    --libdir=%{_libdir} \
    --libexecdir=%{_libexecdir} \
    --mandir=%{_mandir} \
    --infodir=%{_infodir} \
    --datadir=%{_datadir} \
    --disable-ipv6 \
    --disable-HOPFPCI
-------------------------------------------------------------
<1> The configure command for NTP.

RTEMS BSP Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To build a package for RTEMS you need to build it with the matching BSP
configuration. A BSP can be built with specific flags that require all code
being used needs to be built with the same flags.


[[H1]]
Configuration
-------------

The RTEMS Source Builder has two types of configuration data:

. Build Sets
. Package Build Configurations

By default these files can be located in two separate directories and
searched. The first directory is +config+ in your current working directory
(+_topdir+) and the second is +config+ located in the base directory of the
RTEMS Source Builder command you run (+_sbdir+). The RTEMS directory +rtems+
located at the top of the RTEMS Source Builder source code is an example of a
specific build configuration directory. You can create custom or private build
configurations and if you run the RTEMS Source Builder command from that
directory your configurations will be used.

[[X1]] The configuration search path is a macro variable and is reference as
+%\{_configdir\}+. It's default is defined as:

-------------------------------------------------------------
_configdir   : dir  optional<2>  %{_topdir}/config:%{_sbdir}/config <1>
-------------------------------------------------------------

<1> The +_topdir+ is the directory you run the command from and +_sbdir+ is the
location of the RTEMS Source Builder command.
<2> A macro definition in a macro file has 4 fields, the label, type,
constraint and the definition.

Build set files have the file extension +.bset+ and the package build
configuration files have the file extension of +.cfg+. The +sb-set-builder+
command will search for _build sets_ and the +sb-builder+ commands works with
package build configuration files.

Both types of configuration files use the \'#' character as a comment
character. Anything after this character on the line is ignored. There is no
block comment.

Source and Patches
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The RTEMS Source Builder provides a flexible way to manage source. Source and
patches are declare in configurations file using the +source+ and +patch+
directives. These are a single line containing a Universal Resource Location or
URL and can contain macros and shell expansions. The <<_prep,%prep>> section
details the source and patch directives

The URL can reference remote and local source and patch resources. The
following schemes are provided:

'http':: Remote access using the HTTP protocol.
'https':: Remote access using the Secure HTTP protocol.
'ftp':: Remote access using the FTP protocol.
'git':: Remote access to a GIT repository.
'cvs':: Remote access to a CVS repository.
'pm':: Remote access to a patch management repository.
'file':: Local access to an existing source directory.

HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Remote access to TAR or ZIP files is provided using HTTP, HTTPS and FTP
protocols. The full URL provided is used to access the remote file including
any query components. The URL is parsed to extract the file component and the
local source directory is checked for that file. If the file is located locally
the remote file is not downloaded. Currently no other checks are made. If a
download fails you need to manually remove the file from the source directory
and start the build process again.

The URL can contain macros. These are expanded before issuing the request to
download the file. The standard GNU GCC compiler source URL is:

-------------------------------------------------------------
%source set<1> gcc<2> ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gcc/gcc-%{gcc_version}/gcc-%{gcc_version}.tar.bz2
-------------------------------------------------------------
<1> The +%source+ command's set command sets the source. The first is set and
following sets are ignored.
<2> The source is part of the +gcc+ group.

The type of compression is automatically detected from the file extension. The
supported compression formats are:

'gz':: GNU ZIP
'bzip2':: BZIP2
'zip':: ZIP
'xy':: XY

The output of the decompression tool is feed to the standard `tar` utility if
not a ZIP file and unpacked into the build directory. ZIP files are unpacked by
the decompression tool and all other files must be in the tar file format.

The +%source+ directive typically supports a single source file tar or zip
file. The +set+ command is used to set the URL for a specific source group. The
first set command encoutner is registered and any further set commands are
ignored. This allows you to define a base standard source location and override
it in build and architecture specific files. You can also add extra source
files to a group. This is typically done when a collection of source is broken
down in a number of smaller files and you require the full package. The
source's +setup+ command must reide in the +%prep:+ section and it unpacks the
source code ready to be built.

If the source URL references the GitHub API server 'https://api.github.com/' a
tarball of the specified version is download. For example the URL for the
STLINK project on GitHub and version is:

-------------------------------------------------------------
%define stlink_version 3494c11
%source set stlink https://api.github.com/repos/texane/stlink/texane-stlink-%{stlink_version}.tar.gz
-------------------------------------------------------------

GIT
^^^

A GIT repository can be cloned and used as source. The GIT repository resides
in the 'source' directory under the `git` directory. You can edit, update and
use the repository as you normally do and the results will used to build the
tools. This allows you to prepare and test patches in the build environment the
tools are built in. The GIT URL only supports the GIT protocol. You can control
the repository via the URL by appending options and arguments to the GIT
path. The options are delimited by `?` and option arguments are delimited from
the options with `=`. The options are:

`protocol`:: Use a specific protocol. The supported values are _ssh_, _git_,
_http_, _https_, _ftp_, _ftps_, _rsync_, and _none_.
`branch`:: Checkout the specified branch.
`pull`:: Perform a pull to update the repository.
`fetch`:: Perform a fetch to get any remote updates.
`reset`:: Reset the repository. Useful to remove any local changes. You can
pass the `hard` argument to force a hard reset.

-------------------------------------------------------------
%source set gcc git://gcc.gnu.org/git/gcc.git?branch=gcc-4_7-branch?reset=hard
-------------------------------------------------------------

This will clone the GCC git repository and checkout the 4.7-branch and perform
a hard reset. You can select specific branches and apply patches. The
repository is cleaned up before each build to avoid various version control
errors that can arise.

The protocol option lets you set a specific protocol. The 'git://' prefix used
by the RSB to select a git repository can be removed using _none_ or replaced
with one of the standard git protcols.

CVS
^^^

A CVS repository can be checked out. CVS is more complex than GIT to handle
because of the modules support. This can effect the paths the source ends up
in. The CVS URL only supports the CVS protocol. You can control the repository
via the URL by appending options and arguments to the CVS path. The options are
delimited by `?` and option arguments are delimited from the options with
`=`. The options are:

`module`:: The module to checkout.
`src-prefix`:: The path into the source where the module starts.
`tag`:: The CVS tag to checkout.
`date`:: The CVS date to checkout.

-------------------------------------------------------------
%source set newlib cvs://pserver:anoncvs@sourceware.org/cvs/src?module=newlib?src-prefix=src
-------------------------------------------------------------

Macros and Defaults
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The RTEMS Source Builder uses tables of _macros_ read in when the tool
runs. The initial global set of macros is called the _defaults_. These values
are read from a file called `defaults.mc` and modified to suite your host. This
host specific adaption lets the Source Builder handle differences in the build
hosts.

Build set and configuration files can define new values updating and extending
the global macro table. For example builds are given a release number. This is
typically a single number at the end of the package name. For example:

-------------------------------------------------------------
%define release 1
-------------------------------------------------------------

Once defined if can be accessed in a build set or package configuration file
with:

-------------------------------------------------------------
%{release}
-------------------------------------------------------------

The +sb-defaults+ command lists the defaults for your host. I will not include
the output of this command because of its size.

-------------------------------------------------------------
$ ../source-builder/sb-defaults
-------------------------------------------------------------

A nested build set is given a separate copy of the global macro maps. Changes
in one change set are not seen in other build sets. That same happens with
configuration files unless inline includes are used. Inline includes are seen
as part of the same build set and configuration and changes are global to that
build set and configuration.

Macro Maps and Files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Macros are read in from files when the tool starts. The default settings are
read from the defaults macro file called `defaults.mc` located in the top level
RTEMS Source Builder command directory. User macros can be read in at start up
by using the `--macros` command line option.

The format for a macro in macro files is:

[options="header,compact",width="50%",cols="15%,15%,15%,55%"]
|=================================
| Name | Type | Attribute | String
|=================================

where 'Name' is a case insensitive macro name, the 'Type' field is:

[horizontal]
`none`:: Nothing, ignore.
`dir`:: A directory path.
`exe`:: An executable path.
`triplet`:: A GNU style architecture, platform, operating system string.

the 'Attribute' field is:

[horizontal]
`none`:: Nothing, ignore
`required`:: The host check must find the executable or path.
`optional`:: The host check generates a warning if not found.
`override`:: Only valid outside of the `global` map to indicate this macro
             overrides the same one in the `global` map when the map containing
             it is selected.
`undefine`:: Only valid outside of the `global` map to undefine the macro if it
             exists in the `global` map when the map containing it is
             selected. The `global` map's macro is not visible but still
             exists.

and the 'String' field is a single or tripled multiline quoted string. The
'String' can contain references to other macros. Macro that loop are not
currently detected and will cause the tool to lock up.

Maps are declared anywhere in the map using the map directive:

-------------------------------------------------------------
# Comments
[my-special-map] <1>
_host:  none, override, 'abc-xyz'
multiline: none, override, '''First line,
second line,
and finally the last line'''
-------------------------------------------------------------
<1> The map is set to `my-special-map`.

Any macro defintions following a map declaration are placed in that map and the
default map is `global` when loading a file. Maps are selected in configuration
files by using the `%select` directive.

-------------------------------------------------------------
%select my-special-map
-------------------------------------------------------------

Selecting a map means all requests for a macro first check the selected map and
if present return that value else the `global` map is used. Any new macros or
changes update only the `global` map. This may change in future releases so
please make sure you use the `override` attribute.

The macro files specificed on the command line are looked for in the
`_configdir` paths. See <<X1,+_configdir+>> variable for details. Included
files need to add the `%{_configdir}` macro to the start of the file.

Macro map files can include other macro map files using the `%include`
directive. The macro map to build _binutils_, _gcc_, _newlib_, _gdb_ and
_RTEMS_ from version control heads is:

-------------------------------------------------------------
# <1>
# Build all tool parts from version control head.
#
%include %{_configdir}/snapshots/binutils-head.mc
%include %{_configdir}/snapshots/gcc-head.mc
%include %{_configdir}/snapshots/newlib-head.mc
%include %{_configdir}/snapshots/gdb-head.mc
-------------------------------------------------------------
<1> The file is `config/snapshots/binutils-gcc-newlib-gdb-head.mc`.

The macro map defaults to `global` at the start of each included file and the
map setting of the macro file including the other macro files does not change.

Personal Macros
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When the tools start to run they will load personal macros. Personal macros are
in the standard format for macros in a file. There are two places personal
macros can be configured. The first is the environment variable
`RSB_MACROS`. If present the macros from the file the environment variable
points to are loaded. The second is a file called `.rsb_macros` in your home
directory. You need to have the environment variable `HOME` defined for this
work.

Report Mailing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The build reports can be mailed to a specific email address to logging and
monitoring. Mailing requires a number of parameters to function. These are:

. To mail address
. From mail address
. SMTP host

.To Mail Address

The +to+ mail address is taken from the macro `%{_mail_tools_to}` and the
default is _rtems-tooltestresults at rtems.org_. You can override the default
with a personal or user macro file or via the command line option _--mail-to_.

.From Mail Address

The +from+ mail address is taken from:

. GIT configuration
. User `.mailrc` file
. Command line

If you have configured an email and name in git it will be used used. If you do
not a check is made for a `.mailrc` file. The environment variable _MAILRC_ is
used if present else your home directory is check. If found the file is scanned
for the `from` setting:

  set from="Foo Bar <foo@bar>"

You can also support a from address on the command line with the _--mail-from_
option.

.SMTP Host

The SMTP host is taken from the macro `%{_mail_smtp_host}` and the default is
`localhost`. You can override the default with a personal or user macro file or
via the command line option _--smtp-host_.

Build Set Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Build set files lets you list the packages in the build set you are defining
and have a file extension of +.bset+. Build sets can define macro variables,
inline include other files and reference other build set or package
configuration files.

Defining macros is performed with the +%define+ macro:

-------------------------------------------------------------
%define _target m32r-rtems4.11
-------------------------------------------------------------

Inline including another file with the +%include+ macro continues processing
with the specified file returning to carry on from just after the include
point.

-------------------------------------------------------------
%include rtems-4.11-base.bset
-------------------------------------------------------------

This includes the RTEMS 4.11 base set of defines and checks. The configuration
paths as defined by +_configdir+ are scanned. The file extension is optional.

You reference build set or package configuration files by placing the file name
on a single line.

-------------------------------------------------------------
tools/rtems-binutils-2.22-1
-------------------------------------------------------------

The +_configdir+ path is scanned for +tools/rtems-binutils-2.22-1.bset+ or
+tools/rtems-binutils-2.22-1.cfg+. Build set files take precedent over package
configuration files. If +tools/rtems-binutils-2.22-1+ is a build set a new
instance of the build set processor is created and if the file is a package
configuration the package is built with the package builder. This all happens
once the build set file has finished being scanned.

Configuration Control
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The RTEMS Souce Builder is designed to fit within most verification and
validation processes. All of the RTEMS Source Builder is source code. The
Python code is source and comes with a commercial friendly license. All
configuration data is text and can be read or parsed with standard text based
tools.

File naming provides configuration management. A specific version of a package
is captured in a specific set of configuration files. The top level
configuration file referenced in a _build set_ or passed to the +sb-builder+
command relates to a specific configuration of the package being built. For
example the RTEMS configuration file +rtems-gcc-4.7.2-newlib-2.0.0-1.cfg+
creates an RTEMS GCC and Newlib package where the GCC version is 4.7.2, the
Newlib version is 2.0.0, plus any RTEMS specific patches that related to this
version. The configuration defines the version numbers of the various parts
that make up this package:

-------------------------------------------------------------
%define gcc_version    4.7.2
%define newlib_version 2.0.0
%define mpfr_version   3.0.1
%define mpc_version    0.8.2
%define gmp_version    5.0.5
-------------------------------------------------------------

The package build options, if there are any are also defined:

-------------------------------------------------------------
%define with_threads 1
%define with_plugin  0
%define with_iconv   1
-------------------------------------------------------------

The generic configuration may provide defaults in case options are not
specified. The patches this specific version of the package requires can be
included:

-------------------------------------------------------------
Patch0: gcc-4.7.2-rtems4.11-20121026.diff
-------------------------------------------------------------

Finally including the GCC 4.7 configuration script:

-------------------------------------------------------------
%include %{_configdir}/gcc-4.7-1.cfg
-------------------------------------------------------------

The +gcc-4.7-1.cfg+ file is a generic script to build a GCC 4.7 compiler with
Newlib. It is not specific to RTEMS. A bare no operating system tool set can be
built with this file.

The +-1+ part of the file names is a revision. The GCC 4.7 script maybe revised
to fix a problem and if this fix effects an existing script the file is copied
and given a +-2+ revision number. Any dependent scripts referencing the earlier
revision number will not be effected by the change. This locks down a specific
configuration over time.

Personal Configurations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The RSB supports personal configurations. You can view the RTEMS support in the
+rtems+ directory as a private configuration tree that resides within the RSB
source. There is also the +bare+ set of configurations. You can create your own
configurations away from the RSB source tree yet use all that the RSB provides.

To create a private configuration change to a suitable directory:

-------------------------------------------------------------
$ cd ~/work
$ mkdir test
$ cd test
$ mkdir config
-------------------------------------------------------------

and create a +config+ directory. Here you can add a new configuration or build
set file. The section 'Adding New Configurations' details how to add a new
confguration.

New Configurations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section describes how to add a new configuration to the RSB. We will add a
configuration to build the Device Tree Compiler. The Device Tree Compiler or
DTC is part of the Flattened Device Tree project and compiles Device Tree
Source (DTS) files into Device Tree Blobs (DTB). DTB files can be loaded by
operating systems and used to locate the various resources such as base
addresses of devices or interrupt numbers allocated to devices. The Device Tree
Compiler source code can be downloaded from http://www.jdl.com/software. The
DTC is supported in the RSB and you can find the configuration files under the
+bare/config+ tree. I suggest you have a brief look over these files.

Layering by Including
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Configurations can be layered using the +%include+ directive. The user invokes
the outer layers which include inner layers until all the required
configuration is present and the package can be built. The outer layers can
provide high level details such as the version and the release and the inner
layers provide generic configuration details that do not change from one
release to another. Macro variables are used to provide the specific
configuration details.

Configuration File Numbering
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Configuration files have a number at the end. This is a release number for that
configuration and it gives us the ability to track a specific configuration for
a specific version. For example lets say the developers of the DTC package
change the build system from a single makefile to autoconf and automake between
version 1.3.0 and version 1.4.0. The configuration file used to build the
package would change have to change. If we did not number the configuration
files the ability to build 1.1.0, 1.2.0 or 1.3.0 would be lost if we update a
common configuration file to build an autoconf and automake version. For
version 1.2.0 the same build script can be used so we can share the same
configuration file between version 1.1.0 and version 1.2.0. An update to any
previous release lets us still build the package.

Common Configuration Scripts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Common configuration scripts that are independent of version, platform and
architecture are useful to everyone. These live in the Source Builder's
configuration directory. Currently there are scripts to build binutils, expat,
DTC, GCC, GDB and libusb. These files contain the recipes to build these
package without the specific details of the versions or patches being
built. They expect to be wrapped by a configuration file that ties the package
to a specific version and optionally specific patches.

DTC Example
^^^^^^^^^^^

We will be building the DTC for your host rather than a package for RTEMS. We
will create a file called +source-builder/config/dtc-1-1.cfg+. This is a common
script that can be used to build a specific version using a general recipe. The
file name is 'dtc-1-1.cfg' where the 'cfg' extension indicates this is a
configuration file. The first *1* says this is for the major release 1 of the
package and the last *1* is the build configuration version.

The file starts with some comments that detail the configuration. If there is
anything unusual about the configuration it is a good idea to add something in
the comments here. The comments are followed by a check for the release. In
this case if a release is not provided a default of 1 is used.

-------------------------------------------------------------
#
# DTC 1.x.x Version 1.
#
# This configuration file configure's, make's and install's DTC.
#

%if %{release} == %{nil}
%define release 1
%endif
-------------------------------------------------------------

The next section defines some information about the package. It does not effect
the build and is used to annotate the reports. It is recommended this
information is kept updated and accurate.

-------------------------------------------------------------
Name:      dtc-%{dtc_version}-%{_host}-%{release}
Summary:   Device Tree Compiler v%{dtc_version} for target %{_target} on host %{_host}
Version:   %{dtc_version}
Release:   %{release}
URL: 	   http://www.jdl.com/software/
BuildRoot: %{_tmppath}/%{name}-root-%(%{__id_u} -n)
-------------------------------------------------------------

The next section defines the source and any patches. In this case there is a
single source package and it can be downloaded using the HTTP protocol. The RSB
knows this is GZip'ped tar file. If more than one package package is needed add
them increasing the index. The +gcc-4.8-1.cfg+ configuration contains examples
of more than one source package as well as conditionally including source
packages based on the outer configuration options.

-------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Source
#
%source set dtc http://www.jdl.com/software/dtc-v%{dtc_version}.tgz
-------------------------------------------------------------

The remainder of the script is broken in to the various phases of a build. They
are:

. Preperation
. Bulding
. Installing, and
. Cleaning

Preparation is the unpacking of the source, applying any patches as well as any
package specific set ups. This part of the script is a standard Unix shell
script. Be careful with the use of '%' and '$'. The RSB uses '%' while the
shell scripts use '$'.

A standard pattern you will observe is the saving of the build's top
directory. This is used instead of changing into a subdirectory and then
changing to the parent when finished. Some hosts will change in a subdirectory
that is a link however changing to the parent does not change back to the
parent of the link rather it changes to the parent of the target of the link
and that is something the RSB nor you can track easily. The RSB configuration
script's are a collection of various subtle issues so please ask if you are
unsure why something is being done a particular way.

The preparation phase will often include source and patch setup commands. Outer
layers can set the source package and add patches as needed while being able to
use a common recipe for the build. Users can override the standard build and
supply a custom patch for testing using the user macro command line interface.

-------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Prepare the source code.
#
%prep
  build_top=$(pwd)

  %source setup dtc -q -n dtc-v%{dtc_version}
  %patch setup dtc -p1

  cd ${build_top}
-------------------------------------------------------------

The configuration file 'gcc-common-1.cfg' is a complex example of source
preparation. It contains a number of source packages and patches and it
combines these into a single source tree for building. It uses links to map
source into the GCC source tree so GCC can be built using the _single source
tree_ method. It also shows how to fetch source code from version
control. Newlib is taken directly from its CVS repository.

Next is the building phase and for the DTC example this is simply a matter of
running +make+. Note the use of the RSB macros for commands. In the case of
'%{\__make}' it maps to the correct make for your host. In the case of BSD
systems we need to use the GNU make and not the GNU make.

If your package requires a configuration stage you need to run this before the
make stage. Again the GCC common configuration file provides a detailed example.

-------------------------------------------------------------
%build
  build_top=$(pwd)

  cd dtc-v%{dtc_version}

  %{build_build_flags}

  %{__make} PREFIX=%{_prefix}

  cd ${build_top}
-------------------------------------------------------------

You can invoke make with the macro '%{?_smp_flags}' as a command line
argument. This macro is controlled by the '--jobs' command line option and the
host CPU detection support in the RSB. If you are on a multicore host you can
increase the build speed using this macro. It also lets you disabled building on
multicores to aid debugging when testing.

Next is the install phase. This phase is a little more complex because you may
be building a tar file and the end result of the build is never actually
installed into the prefix on the build host and you may not even have
permissions to perform a real install. Most packages install to the +prefix+
and the prefix is typically supplied via the command to the RSB or the
package's default is used. The default can vary depending on the host's
operating system. To install to a path that is not the prefix the +DESTDIR+
make variable is used. Most packages should honour the +DISTDIR+ make variables
and you can typically specify it on the command line to make when invoking the
install target. This results in the package being installed to a location that
is not the prefix but one you can control. The RSB provides a shell variable
called +SB_BUILD_ROOT+ you can use. In a build set where you are building a
number of packages you can collect all the built packages in a single tree that
is captured in the tar file.

Also note the use of the macro +%{\__rmdir}+. The use of these macros allow the
RSB to vary specific commands based on the host. This can help on hosts like
Windows where bugs can effect the standard commands such as 'rm'. There are
many many macros to help you. You can find these listed in the +defaults.mc+
file and in the trace output. If you are new to creating and editing
configurations learning these can take a little time.

-------------------------------------------------------------
%install
  build_top=$(pwd)

  %{__rmdir} -rf $SB_BUILD_ROOT

  cd dtc-v%{dtc_version}
  %{__make} DESTDIR=$SB_BUILD_ROOT PREFIX=%{_prefix} install

  cd ${build_top}
-------------------------------------------------------------

Finally there is an optional clean section. The RSB will run this section if
+--no-clean+ has not been provided on the command line. The RSB does clean up
for you.

Once we have the configuration files we can execute the build using the
`sb-builder` command. The command will perform the build and create a tar file
in the +tar+ directory.

-------------------------------------------------------------
$  ../source-builder/sb-builder --prefix=/usr/local \
     --log=log_dtc devel/dtc-1.2.0
RTEMS Source Builder, Package Builder v0.2.0
config: devel/dtc-1.2.0
package: dtc-1.2.0-x86_64-freebsd9.1-1
download: http://www.jdl.com/software/dtc-v1.2.0.tgz -> sources/dtc-v1.2.0.tgz
building: dtc-1.2.0-x86_64-freebsd9.1-1
$ ls tar
dtc-1.2.0-x86_64-freebsd9.1-1.tar.bz2
-------------------------------------------------------------

If you want to have the package installed automatically you need to create a
build set. A build set can build one or more packages from their configurations
at once to create a single package. For example the GNU tools is typically seen
as binutils, GCC and GDB and a build set will build each of these packages and
create a single build set tar file or install the tools on the host into the
prefix path.

The DTC build set file is called +dtc.bset+ and contains:

-------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Build the DTC.
#

%define release 1

devel/dtc-1.2.0.cfg
-------------------------------------------------------------

To build this you can use something similar to:

-------------------------------------------------------------
$ ../source-builder/sb-set-builder --prefix=/usr/local --log=log_dtc \
   --trace --bset-tar-file --no-install dtc
RTEMS Source Builder - Set Builder, v0.2.0
Build Set: dtc
config: devel/dtc-1.2.0.cfg
package: dtc-1.2.0-x86_64-freebsd9.1-1
building: dtc-1.2.0-x86_64-freebsd9.1-1
tarball: tar/x86_64-freebsd9.1-dtc-set.tar.bz2
cleaning: dtc-1.2.0-x86_64-freebsd9.1-1
Build Set: Time 0:00:02.865758
$ ls tar
dtc-1.2.0-x86_64-freebsd9.1-1.tar.bz2   x86_64-freebsd9.1-dtc-set.tar.bz2
-------------------------------------------------------------

The build is for a FreeBSD host and the prefix is for user installed
packages. In this example I cannot let the source builder perform the install
because I never run the RSB with root priviledges so a build set or bset tar
file is created. This can then be installed using root privildges.

The command also supplies the --trace option. The output in the log file will
contian all the macros.

Debugging
^^^^^^^^^

New configuration files require debugging. There are two types of
debugging. The first is debugging RSB script bugs. The +--dry-run+ option is
used here. Suppling this option will result in most of the RSB processing to be
performed and suitable output placed in the log file. This with the +--trace+
option should help you resolve any issues.

The second type of bug to fix are related to the execution of one of
phases. These are usually a mix of shell script bugs or package set up or
configuration bugs. Here you can use any normal shell script type debug
technique such as +set -x+ to output the commands or +echo+
statements. Debugging package related issues may require you start a build with
teh RSB and supply +--no-clean+ option and then locate the build directories
and change directory into them and manually run commands until to figure what
the package requires.

Snapshot Testing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

_This section needs to be updated once I sort out snapshot testing._

Testing of release canidates and snapshots is important to those helping
maintain tool sets. The RTEMS Source Builder helps by providing a simple and
flexible way to use existing build sets and configuration without needing to
change them or creating new temporary build sets and configurations.

The process uses snapshot macro files loaded via the command line option
`--macros`. These files provide macros that override the standard build set and
configuration file macros.

Lets consider testing a GCC 4.7 snapshot for RTEMS 4.11. Lets assume the
current RTEMS 4.11 tools reference GCC 4.7.3 with a patch as the stable tool
set. We want to use a recent snapshot with no patches. In the
`rtems/config/snapshots` directoy create a file called `gcc-4.7-snapshot.mc`
containing:

-------------------------------------------------------------
[gcc-4.7-snapshot]
GCC_Version: none, override, '4.7-20130413'
Source:     none, override, 'http://mirrors.kernel.org/sources.redhat.com/gcc/
snapshots/%{gcc_version}/gcc-%{gcc_version}.tar.bz2'
Patch0:      none, udefine,  ''
-------------------------------------------------------------

In the standard configuration file `source-builder/config/gcc-4.7-1.cfg` the
map is selected with:

-------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Select the GCC 4.7 Snapshot Macro Map
#
%select gcc-4.7-snapshot
-------------------------------------------------------------

On the command line add `--macros=snapshots/gcc-4.7-snapshot.mc` and this
snapshot will be built. With careful use of the `--prefix` option you can
locate the tools in a specific directory and test them without needing to
effect your production environment.

Scripting
~~~~~~~~~

Configuration files specify how to build a package. Configuration files are
scripts and have a +.cfg+ file extension. The script format is based loosely on
the RPM spec file format however the use and purpose in this tool does not
compare with the functionality and therefore the important features of the spec
format RPM needs and uses.

The script language is implemented in terms of macros. The built-in list is:

[horizontal]
+%{}+:: Macro expansion with conditional logic.
+%()+:: Shell expansion.
+%prep+:: The source preparation shell commands.
+%build+:: The build shell commands.
+%install+:: The package install shell commands.
+%clean+:: The package clean shell commands.
+%include+:: Inline include another configuration file.
+%name+:: The name of the package.
+%summary+:: A brief package description. Useful when reporting about a build.
+%release+:: The package release. A number that is the release as built by this tool.
+%version+:: The package's version string.
+%buildarch+:: The build architecture.
+%source+:: Define a source code package. This macro has a number appended.
+%patch+:: Define a patch. This macro has a is number appended.
+%hash+:: Define a checksum for a source or patch file.
+%echo+:: Print the following string as a message.
+%warning+:: Print the following string as a warning and continue.
+%error+:: Print the following string as an error and exit.
+%select+:: Select the macro map. If there is no map nothing is reported.
+%define+:: Define a macro. Macros cannot be redefined, you must first undefine it.
+%undefine+:: Undefine a macro.
+%if+:: Start a conditional logic block that ends with a +%endif+.
+%ifn+:: Inverted start of a conditional logic block.
+%ifarch+:: Test the architecture against the following string.
+%ifnarch+:: Inverted test of the architecture
+%ifos+:: Test the host operating system.
+%else+:: Start the _else_ conditional logic block.
+%endfi+:: End the conditional logic block.
+%bconf_with+:: Test the build condition _with_ setting. This is the +--with-*+
command line option.
+%bconf_without+:: Test the build condition _without_ setting. This is the
+--without-*+ command line option.

Expanding
^^^^^^^^^

A macro can be `%{string}` or the equivalent of `%string`. The following macro
expansions supported are:

`%{string}`;;
Expand the 'string' replacing the entire macro text with the text in the table
for the entry 'string . For example if 'var' is 'foo' then `${var}` would
become `foo`.

`%{expand: string}`;;
Expand the 'string' and then use it as a ``string'' to the macro expanding the
macro. For example if _foo_ is set to 'bar' and 'bar' is set to 'foobar' then
`%{expand:foo}` would result in `foobar`. Shell expansion can also be used.

`%{with string}`;;
Expand the macro to '1' if the macro `with_`'string' is defined else expand to
_0_. Macros with the name `with_`'string' can be define with command line
arguments to the RTEMS Source Builder commands.

`%{defined string}`;;
Expand the macro to '1' if a macro of name 'string' is defined else expand to '0'.

`%{?string: expression}`;;
Expand the macro to 'expression' if a macro of name 'string' is defined else expand to `%{nil}`.

`%{!?string: expression}`;;
Expand the macro to 'expression' if a macro of name 'string' is not defined. If
the macro is define expand to `%{nil}`.

`%(expression)`;;
Expand the macro to the result of running the 'expression' in a host shell. It
is assumed this is a Unix type shell. For example `%(whoami)` will return your
user name and `%(date)` will return the current date string.

%prep
^^^^^

The +%prep+ macro starts a block that continues until the next block macro. The
_prep_ or preparation block defines the setup of the package's source and is a
mix of RTEMS Source Builder macros and shell scripting. The sequence is
typically +%source+ macros for source, +%patch+ macros to patch the source
mixed with some shell commands to correct any source issues.

-------------------------------------------------------------
              <1>                <2>      <3>
%source setup gcc -q -c -T -n %{name}-%{version}
-------------------------------------------------------------

<1> The source group to set up.
<2> The source's name.
<3> The version of the source.

The source set up are declared with the source +set+ and +add+ commands. For
example:

-------------------------------------------------------------
%source set gdb http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gdb/gdb-%{gdb_version}.tar.bz2
-------------------------------------------------------------

This URL is the primary location of the GNU GDB source code and the RTEMS
Source Builder can download the file from this location and by inspecting the
file extension use +bzip2+ decompression with +tar+. When the +%prep+ section
is processed a check of the local +source+ directory is made to see if the file
has already been downloaded. If not found in the source cache directory the
package is downloaded from the URL. You can append other base URLs via the
command line option +--url+. This option accepts a comma delimited list of
sites to try.

You could optionally have a few source files that make up the package. For
example GNU's GCC was a few tar files for a while and it is now a single tar
file. Support for multiple source files can be conditionally implemented with
the following scripting:

-------------------------------------------------------------
%source set gcc ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gcc/gcc-%{gcc_version}/gcc-code-%{gcc_version}.tar.bz2
%source add gcc ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gcc/gcc-%{gcc_version}/gcc-g++-%{gcc_version}.tar.bz2
%source setup gcc -q -T -D -n gcc-%{gcc_version}
-------------------------------------------------------------

Separate modules use separate source groups. The GNU GCC compiler for RTEMS
uses Newlib, MPFR, MPC, and GMP source packages. You define the source with:

-------------------------------------------------------------
%source set gcc ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gcc/gcc-%{gcc_version}/gcc-%{gcc_version}.tar.bz2
%source set newlib ftp://sourceware.org/pub/newlib/newlib-%{newlib_version}.tar.gz
%source set mpfr http://www.mpfr.org/mpfr-%{mpfr_version}/mpfr-%{mpfr_version}.tar.bz2
%source set mpc http://www.multiprecision.org/mpc/download/mpc-%{mpc_version}.tar.gz
%source set gmp ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gmp/gmp-%{gmp_version}.tar.bz2
-------------------------------------------------------------

and set up with:

-------------------------------------------------------------
%source setup gcc -q -n gcc-%{gcc_version}
%source setup newlib -q -D -n newlib-%{newlib_version}
%source setup mpfr -q -D -n mpfr-%{mpfr_version}
%source setup mpc -q -D -n mpc-%{mpc_version}
%source setup gmp -q -D -n gmp-%{gmp_version}
-------------------------------------------------------------

Patching also occurs during the preparation stage. Patches are handled in a
similar way to the source packages except you only +add+ patches. Patches are
applied using the +setup+ command. The +setup+ command takes the default patch
option. You can provide options with each patch by adding them as arguments
before the patch URL. Patches with no options uses the +setup+ default.

-------------------------------------------------------------
%patch add gdb %{rtems_gdb_patches}/gdb-sim-arange-inline.diff
%patch add gdb -p0 <1> %{rtems_gdb_patches}/gdb-sim-cgen-inline.diff
-------------------------------------------------------------
<1> This patch has a custom option.

To apply these patches:

-------------------------------------------------------------
%patch setup gdb -p1 <1>
-------------------------------------------------------------
<1> The default options.

%build
^^^^^^

The +%build+ macro starts a block that continues until the next block
macro. The build block is a series of shell commands that execute to build the
package. It assumes all source code has been unpacked, patch and adjusted so
the build will succeed.

The following is an example take from the GutHub STLink project:

NOTE: STLink is a JTAG debugging device for the ST ARM family of processors.

-------------------------------------------------------------
%build
  export PATH="%{_bindir}:${PATH}" <1>

  cd texane-stlink-%{stlink_version} <2>

  ./autogen.sh <3>

%if "%{_build}" != "%{_host}"
  CFLAGS_FOR_BUILD="-g -O2 -Wall" \ <4>
%endif
  CPPFLAGS="-I $SB_TMPPREFIX/include/libusb-1.0" \ <5>
  CFLAGS="$SB_OPT_FLAGS" \
  LDFLAGS="-L $SB_TMPPREFIX/lib" \
  ./configure \ <6>
    --build=%{_build} --host=%{_host} \
    --verbose \
    --prefix=%{_prefix} --bindir=%{_bindir} \
    --exec-prefix=%{_exec_prefix} \
    --includedir=%{_includedir} --libdir=%{_libdir} \
    --mandir=%{_mandir} --infodir=%{_infodir}

  %{__make} %{?_smp_mflags} all <7>

  cd ..
-------------------------------------------------------------

<1> Setup the PATH environment variable. This is not always needed.
<2> This package builds in the source tree so enter it.
<3> The package is actually checked directly out from the github project and so
    it needs its autoconf and automake files generated.
<4> Flags for a cross-compiled build.
<5> Various settings passed to configure to customise the build. In this
    example an include path is being set to the install point of _libusb_. This
    package requires _libusb_ is built before it.
<6> The +configure+ command. The RTEMS Source Builder provides all the needed
    paths as macro variables. You just need to provide them to +configure+.
<7> Running make. Do not use +make+ directly, use the RTEMS Source Builder's
    defined value. This value is specific to the host. A large number of
    packages need GNU make and on BSD systems this is +gmake+. You can
    optionally add the SMP flags if the packages build system can handle
    parallel building with multiple jobs. The +_smp_mflags+ value is
    automatically setup for SMP hosts to match the number of cores the host has.

%install
^^^^^^^^

The +%install+ macro starts a block that continues until the next block
macro. The install block is a series of shell commands that execute to install
the package. You can assume the package has build correctly when this block
starts executing.

Never install the package to the actual _prefix_ the package was built
with. Always install to the RTEMS Source Builder's temporary path defined in
the macro variable +\__tmpdir+. The RTEMS Source Builder sets up a shell
environment variable called +SB_BUILD_ROOT+ as the standard install point. Most
packages support adding +DESTDIR=+ to the _make install_ command.

Looking at the same example as in <<_build, %build>>:

-------------------------------------------------------------
%install
  export PATH="%{_bindir}:${PATH}" <1>
  rm -rf $SB_BUILD_ROOT <2>

  cd texane-stlink-%{stlink_version} <3>
  %{__make} DESTDIR=$SB_BUILD_ROOT install <4>

  cd ..
-------------------------------------------------------------

<1> Setup the PATH environment variable. This is not always needed.
<2> Clean any installed files. This make sure the install is just what
    the package installs and not any left over files from a broken build or
    install.
<3> Enter the build directory. In this example it just happens to be the source
    directory.
<4> Run +make install+ to install the package overriding the +DESTDIR+ make
    variable.

%clean
^^^^^^

The +%clean+ macro starts a block that continues until the next block
macro. The clean block is a series of shell commands that execute to clean up
after a package has been built and install. This macro is currenly not been
used because the RTEMS Source Builder automatically cleans up.

%include
^^^^^^^^

The +%include+ macro inline includes the specific file. The +\__confdir+
path is searched. Any relative path component of the include file is appended
to each part of the +\__configdir+. Adding an extension is optional as files
with +.bset+ and +.cfg+ are automatically searched for.

Inline including means the file is processed as part of the configuration at
the point it is included. Parsing continues from the next line in the
configuration file that contains the +%include+ macro.

Including files allow a kind of configuration file reuse. The outer
configuration files provide specific information such as package version
numbers and patches and then include a generic configuration script which
builds the package.

-------------------------------------------------------------
%include %{_configdir}/gcc-4.7-1.cfg
-------------------------------------------------------------

%name
^^^^^

The name of the package being built. The name typically contains the components
of the package and their version number plus a revision number. For the GCC
with Newlib configuration the name is typically:

-------------------------------------------------------------
Name: %{_target}-gcc-%{gcc_version}-newlib-%{newlib_version}-%{release}
-------------------------------------------------------------

%summary
^^^^^^^^

The +%summary+ is a brief description of the package. It is useful when
reporting. This information is not capture in the package anywhere. For the GCC
with Newlib configuration the summary is typically:

-------------------------------------------------------------
Summary: GCC v%{gcc_version} and Newlib v%{newlib_version} for target %{_target} on host %{_host}
-------------------------------------------------------------

%release
^^^^^^^^

The +%release+ is packaging number that allows revisions of a package to happen
where none package versions change. This value typically increases when the
configuration building the package changes.

-------------------------------------------------------------
%define release 1
-------------------------------------------------------------

%version
^^^^^^^^

The +%version% macro sets the version the package. If the package is a single
component it tracks that component's version number. For example in the
_libusb_ configuration the +%version+ is the same as +%libusb_version+, however
in a GCC with Newlib configuration there is no single version number. In this
case the GCC version is used.

-------------------------------------------------------------
Version: %{gcc_version}
-------------------------------------------------------------

%buildarch
^^^^^^^^^^

The +%buildarch+ macro is set to the architecture the package contains. This is
currently not used in the RTEMS Source Builder and may go away. This macro is
more important in a real packaging system where the package could end up on the
wrong architecture.

%source
^^^^^^^

The +%source+ macro has 3 commands that controls what it does. You can +set+
the source files, +add+ source files to a source group, and +setup+ the source
file group getting it ready to be used.

Source files are source code files in tar or zip files that are unpacked,
copied or symbolically linked into the package's build tree. Building a package
requires one or more dependent packages. These are typically the packages
source code plus dependent libraries or modules. You can create any number of
these source groups and set each of them up with a separe source group for each
needed library or module. Each source group normally has a single tar, zip or
repository and the +set+ defines this. Some projects split the source code into
separate tar or zip files and you install them by using the +add+ command.

The first instance of a +set+ command creates the source group and sets the
source files to be set up. Subsequence +set+ commands for the same source group
are ignored. this lets you define the standard source files and override them
for specific releases or snapshots.. To set a source file group:

-------------------------------------------------------------
%source set gcc <1> ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gcc/gcc-%{gcc_version}/gcc-%{gcc_version}.tar.bz2
-------------------------------------------------------------
<1> The source group is +gcc+.

To add another source package to be installed into the same source tree you use
the +add+ command:

-------------------------------------------------------------
%source add gcc ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gcc/gcc-%{gcc_version}/g++-%{gcc_version}.tar.bz2
-------------------------------------------------------------

The source +setup+ command can only be issued in the +%prep:+ section. The
setup is:

-------------------------------------------------------------
%source gcc setup -q -T -D -n %{name}-%{version}
-------------------------------------------------------------

Accepted options are:

[horizontal]
*Switch*:: *Description*
+-n+:: The -n option is used to set the name of the software's build
directory. This is necessary only when the source archive unpacks into a
directory named other than +<name>-<version>+.
+-c+:: The -c option is used to direct %setup to create the top-level build
directory before unpacking the sources.
+-D+:: The -D option is used to direct %setup to not delete the build directory
prior to unpacking the sources. This option is used when more than one source
archive is to be unpacked into the build directory, normally with the +-b+ or
+-a+ options.
+-T+:: The -T option is used to direct %setup to not perform the default
unpacking of the source archive specified by the first Source: macro. It is used
with the +-a+ or +-b+ options.
+-b <n>+:: The -b option is used to direct %setup to unpack the source archive
specified on the nth Source: macro line before changing directory into the build
directory.

%patch
^^^^^^

The +%patch+ macro has the same 3 command as the +%source+ command however the
+set+ commands is not really that useful with the with command. You add patches
with the +add+ command and +setup+ applies the patches. Patch options can be
added to each patch by placing them before the patch URL. If no patch option is
provided the default options passed to the +setup+ command are used. An option
starts with a '-'. The +setup+ command must reside inside the +%prep+ section.

Patches are grouped in a similar way to the +%source+ macro so you can control
applying a group of patches to a specific source tree.

The +__patchdir+ path is search.

To add a patch:

-------------------------------------------------------------
%patch add gcc <1>  gcc-4.7.2-rtems4.11-20121026.diff
%patch add gcc -p0 <2>  gcc-4.7.2-rtems4.11-20121101.diff
-------------------------------------------------------------
<1> The patch group is +gcc+.
<2> Option for this specific patch.

Placing +%patch setup+ in the +%prep+ section will apply the groups patches.

-------------------------------------------------------------
%patch setup gcc <1>  -p1 <2>
-------------------------------------------------------------
<1> The patch group.
<2> The default option used to apply the patch.

%hash
^^^^^

The +%hash+ macro requires 3 arguments and defines a checksum for a specific
file. The checksum is not applied until the file is checked before downloading
and once downloaded. A patch or source file that does not has a hash defined
generates a warning.

A file to be checksum must be unqiue in the any of the source and patch
directories. The basename of the file is used as the key for the hash.

The hash algorthim can be 'md5', 'sha1', 'sha224', 'sha256', 'sha384', and
'sha512' and we typically use 'md5'.

To add a hash:

-------------------------------------------------------------
%hash md5 <1> net-snmp-%{net_snmp_version}.tar.gz <2> 7db683faba037249837b226f64d566d4 <3>
-------------------------------------------------------------
<1> The type of checksum.
<2> The file to checksum. It can contain macros that are expanded for you.
<3> The MD5 hash for the Net-SNMP file +net-snmp-5.7.2.1.tar.gz+.

Do not include a path with the file name. Only the basename is required. Files
can be searched for from a number of places and having a path conponent would
create confusion. This does mean files with hashes must be unique.

Downloading of repositories such as git and cvs cannot be checksumed. It is
assumed those protocols and tools manage the state of the files.

%echo
^^^^^

The +%echo+ macro outputs the following string to stdout. This can also be used
as `%{echo: message}`.

%warning
^^^^^^^^

The +%warning+ macro outputs the following string as a warning. This can also
be used as `%{warning: message}`.

%error
^^^^^^

The +%error+ macro outputs the follow string as an error and exits the RTEMS
Source Builder. This can also be used as `%{error: message}`.

%select
^^^^^^^

The +%select+ macro selects the map specified. If there is no map no error or
warning is generated. Macro maps provide a simple way for a user to override
the settings is a configuration file without having to edit it. The changes are
recorded in the build report so can be traced.

Configuration use different maps so macro overrides can target a specific
package.

The default map is `global'.

-------------------------------------------------------------
%select gcc-4.8-snapshot <1>
%define one_plus_one 2 <2>
-------------------------------------------------------------

<1> The map switches to `gcc-4.8-snapshot`. Any overrides in this map will be
    used.
<2> Defining macros only updates the `global` map and not the selected map.

%define
^^^^^^^

The +%define+ macro defines a new macro or updates an existing one. If no value
is given it is assumed to be 1.

-------------------------------------------------------------
%define foo bar
%define one_plus_one 2
%define one <1>
-------------------------------------------------------------

<1> The macro _one_ is set to 1.

%undefine
^^^^^^^^^

The +%undefine+ macro removes a macro if it exists. Any further references to
it will result in an undefine macro error.

%if
^^^

The +%if+ macro starts a conditional logic block that can optionally have a
_else_ section. A test follows this macro and can have the following operators:

[horizontal]
*Operator*:: *Description*
+%{}+:: Check the macro is set or _true_, ie non-zero.
+
-------------------------------------------------------------
%if ${foo}
 %warning The test passes, must not be empty or is non-zero
%else
 %error The test fails, must be empty or zero
%endif
-------------------------------------------------------------
+!+:: The _not_ operator inverts the test of the macro.
+
-------------------------------------------------------------
%if ! ${foo}
 %warning The test passes, must be empty or zero
%else
 %error The test fails, must not be empty or is non-zero
%endif
-------------------------------------------------------------
+==+:: The left hand size must equal the right hand side. For example:
+
-------------------------------------------------------------
%define one 1
%if ${one} == 1
 %warning The test passes
%else
 %error The test fails
%endif
-------------------------------------------------------------
+
You can also check to see if a macro is empty:
+
-------------------------------------------------------------
%if ${nothing} == %{nil}
 %warning The test passes
%else
 %error The test fails
%endif
-------------------------------------------------------------
+!=+:: The left hand size does not equal the right hand side. For example:
+
-------------------------------------------------------------
%define one 1
%if ${one} != 2
 %warning The test passes
%else
 %error The test fails
%endif
-------------------------------------------------------------
+
You can also check to see if something is set:
+
-------------------------------------------------------------
%if ${something} != %{nil}
 %warning The test passes
%else
 %error The test fails
%endif
-------------------------------------------------------------
+>+:: The left hand side is numerically greater than the right hand side.
+>=+:: The left hand side is numerically greater than or equal to the right
hand side.
+<+:: The left hand side is numerically less than the right hand side.
+\<=+:: The left hand side is numerically less than or equal to the right hand
side.

%ifn
^^^^

The +%ifn+ macro inverts the normal +%if+ logic. It avoids needing to provide
empty _if_ blocks followed by _else_ blocks. It is useful when checking if a
macro is defined:

-------------------------------------------------------------
%ifn %{defined foo}
 %define foo bar
%endif
-------------------------------------------------------------

%ifarch
^^^^^^^

The +%ifarch+ is a short cut for "+%if %{\_arch} == i386+". Currently not used.

%ifnarch
^^^^^^^^

The +%ifnarch+ is a short cut for "+%if %{\_arch} != i386+". Currently not
used.

%ifos
^^^^^

The +%ifos+ is a short cut for "+%if %{\_os} != mingw32+". It allows
conditional support for various operating system differences when building
packages.

%else
^^^^^

The +%else+ macro starts the conditional _else_ block.

%endfi
^^^^^^

The +%endif+ macro ends a conditional logic block.

%bconf_with
^^^^^^^^^^^

The +%bconf_with+ macro provides a way to test if the user has passed a
specific option on the command line with the +--with-<label>+ option. This
option is only available with the +sb-builder+ command.

%bconf_without
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The +%bconf_without+ macro provides a way to test if the user has passed a
specific option on the command line with the +--without-<label>+ option. This
option is only available with the +sb-builder+ command.

-------------------------------------------------------------

.Arguments
The +[args]+ are a list build sets to build.

.Options
+--force+;;
Force the build to proceed even if the host check fails. Typically this happens
if executable files are found in the path at a different location to the host
defaults.
+--trace+;;
Trace enable printing of debug information to stdout. It is really only of use
to RTEMS Source Builder's developers.
+--dry-run+;;
Do everything but actually run the build commands. This is useful when checking
a new configuration parses cleanly.
+--warn-all+;;
Generate warnings.
+--no-clean+;;
Do not clean up the build tree during the cleaning phase of the build. This
leaves the source and the build output on disk so you can make changes, or
amend or generate new patches. It also allows you to review configure type
output such as +config.log+.
+--always-clean+;;
Clean away the results of a build even if the build fails. This is normally
used with `--keep-going` when regression testing to see which build sets
fail to build. It keeps the disk usage down.
+--jobs+;;
Control the number of jobs make is given. The jobs can be 'none' for only 1
job, 'half' so the number of jobs is half the number of detected cores, a
fraction such as '0.25' so the number of jobs is a quarter of the number of
detected cores and a number such as '25' which forces the number of jobs to
that number.
+--host+;;
Set the host triplet value. Be careful with this option.
+--build+;;
Set the build triplet. Be careful with this option.
+--target+;;
Set the target triplet. Be careful with this option. This is useful if you have
a generic configuration script that can work for a range of architectures.
+--prefix path+;;
Tools build prefix, ie where they are installed.
+--topdir path+;;
Top of the build tree, that is the current directory you are in.
+--configdir path+;;
Path to the configuration directory. This overrides the built in defaults.
+--builddir path+;;
Path to the build directory. This overrides the default of +build+.
+--sourcedir path+;;
Path to the source directory. This overrides the default of +source+.
+--tmppath path+;;
Path to the temporary directory. This overrides the default of +tmp+.
+--macros files+;;
Macro files to load. The configuration directory path is searched.
+--log file+;;
Log all the output from the build process. The output is directed to +stdout+
if no log file is provided.
+--url url+;;
URL to look for source when downloading. This is can be comma separate list.
+--no-download+;;
Disable downloading of source and patches. If the source is not found an error
is raised.
+--targetcflags flags+;;
List of C flags for the target code. This allows for specific local
customisation when testing new variations.
+--targetcxxflags flags+;;
List of C++ flags for the target code. This allows for specific local
customisation when testing new variations.
+--libstdcxxflags flags+;;
List of C\++ flags to build the target libstdc++ code. This allows for specific
local customisation when testing new variations.
+--with-<label>+;;
Add the --with-<label> to the build. This can be tested for in a script with
the +%bconf_with+ macro.
+--without-<label>+;;
Add the --without-<label> to the build. This can be tested for in a script with
the +%bconf_without+ macro.
+--mail-from+;;
Set the from mail address if report mailing is enabled.
+--mail-to+;;
Set the to mail address if report mailing is enabled. The report is mailed to
this address.
+--mail+;;
Mail the build report to the mail to address.
+--smtp-host+;;
The SMTP host to use to send the email. The default is +localhost+.
+--no-report+;;
Do not create a report format.
+--report-format format+;;
The report format can be 'text' or 'html'. The default is 'html'.
+--keep-going+;;
Do not stop on error. This is useful if your build sets performs a large number
of testing related builds and there are errors.
+--always-clean+.
Always clean the build tree even with a failure.
+--no-install+;;
Do not install the packages to the prefix. Use this if you are only after the
tar files.
+--regression+;;
A convenience option which is the same as +--no-install+, +--keep-going+ and
+--bset-tar-file+;;
Create a build set tar file. This is a single tar file of all the packages in
the build set.
+--pkg-tar-files+;;
Create package tar files. A tar file will be created for each package built in
a build set.
+--list-bsets+;;
List available build sets.
+--list-configs+;;
List available configurations.
+--list-deps+;;
Print a list of dependent files used by a build set. Dependent files have a
'dep[?]' prefix where '?' is a number. The files are listed alphabetically.

Host Setups
-----------

The host versions are listed. If a later version of the host operating system
exists it should work unless listed.

Please provide patches to update these sections if they are wrong or need
updating. I cannot install and test each one and rely on getting your feedback.

Linux
~~~~~

A number of different Linux distrubutions are known to work. The following have
been tested and report as working.

Archlinux
^^^^^^^^^

The following packages are required on a fresh Archlinux 64bit installation:

--------------------------------------------------------------
# pacman -S base-devel gdb xz unzip ncurses git zlib
--------------------------------------------------------------

Archlinux, by default installs `texinfo-5` which is incompatible for building
GCC 4.7 tree. You will have to obtain `texinfo-legacy` from `AUR` and provide
a manual override.

--------------------------------------------------------------
# pacman -R texinfo
$ yaourt -S texinfo-legacy
# ln -s /usr/bin/makeinfo-4.13a /usr/bin/makeinfo
--------------------------------------------------------------

CentOS
^^^^^^

The following packages are required on a minimal CentOS 6.3 64bit installation:

-------------------------------------------------------------
# yum install autoconf automake binutils gcc gcc-c++ gdb make patch \
bison flex xz unzip ncurses-devel texinfo zlib-devel python-devel git
-------------------------------------------------------------

The minimal CentOS distribution is a specific DVD that installs a minimal
system. If you use a full system some of these packages may have been
installed.

Fedora
^^^^^^

The RTEMS Source Builder has been tested on Fedora 19 64bit with the following packages.

-------------------------------------------------------------
# yum install ncurses-devel python-devel git bison gcc cvs gcc-c++ \
         flex texinfo patch perl-Text-ParseWords zlib-devel
-------------------------------------------------------------

Raspbian
^^^^^^^^

The is the Debian distribution for the Raspberry Pi. The following packages are
required.

-------------------------------------------------------------
$ sudo apt-get install autoconf automake bison flex binutils gcc g++ gdb \
texinfo unzip ncurses-dev python-dev git
-------------------------------------------------------------

It is recommended you get Model B of the Pi with 512M of memory and to mount a
remote disk over the network. The tools can be build with a prefix under your
home directory as recommended and end up on the SD card.

Ubuntu
^^^^^^

The latest testing was with Ubuntu 13.10 64bit. This section also includes Xubuntu. A
minimal installation was used and the following packages installed.

-------------------------------------------------------------
$ sudo apt-get build-dep binutils gcc g++ gdb unzip git python2.7-dev
-------------------------------------------------------------

FreeBSD
~~~~~~~

The RTEMS Source Builder has been tested on FreeBSD 9.1 and 10.0 64bit. You
need to install some ports. They are:

-------------------------------------------------------------
# cd /usr/ports
# portinstall --batch lang/python27
-------------------------------------------------------------

If you wish to build Windows (mingw32) tools please install the following
ports:

-------------------------------------------------------------
# cd /usr/ports
# portinstall --batch devel/mingw32-binutils devel/mingw32-gcc
# portinstall --batch devel/mingw32-zlib devel/mingw32-pthreads
-------------------------------------------------------------

The +zlip+ and +pthreads+ ports for MinGW32 are used for builiding a Windows
QEMU.

If you are on FreeBSD 10.0 and you have pkgng installed you can use 'pkg
install' rather than 'portinstall'.

NetBSD
~~~~~~

The RTEMS Source Builder has been tested on NetBSD 6.1 i386. Packages to add
are:

-------------------------------------------------------------
# pkg_add ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/pkgsrc/packages/NetBSD/i386/6.1/devel/gmake-3.82nb7.tgz
# pkg_add ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/pkgsrc/packages/NetBSD/i386/6.1/devel/bison-2.7.1.tgz
# pkg_add ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/pkgsrc/packages/NetBSD/i386/6.1/archivers/xz-5.0.4.tgz
-------------------------------------------------------------

MacOS
~~~~~

The RTEMS Source Builder has been tested on Mountain Lion. You will need to
install the Xcode app using the _App Store_ tool, run Xcode and install the
Developers Tools package within Xcode.

Mavericks
^^^^^^^^^

The RSB works on Mavericks and the GNU tools can be built for RTEMS using the
Mavericks clang LLVM tool chain. You will need to build and install a couple of
packages to make the RSB pass the +sb-check+. These are CVS and XZ. You can get
these tools from a packaging tool for MacOS such as _MacPorts_ or _HomeBrew_.

I do not use 3rd party packaging on MacOS and prefer to build the packages from
source using a prefix of '/usr/local'. There are good 3rd party packages around
however they sometimes bring in extra dependence and that complicates my build
environment and I want to know the minimal requirements when building
tools. The following are required:

. The XZ package's home page is http://tukaani.org/xz/ and I use version
  5.0.5. XZ builds and installs cleanly.

. CVS can be found at http://cvs.nongnu.org/ and I use version 1.11.23. CVS
  requires the following patch
  http://www.rtems.org/ftp/pub/rtems/people/chrisj/source-builder/cvs-1.11.23-osx-maverick.diff
  to build. Place the diff in the same directory as the unpacked cvs-1.11.23
  and apply with +patch -p0 < cvs-1.11.23-osx-maverick.diff+.

Windows
~~~~~~~

Windows tool sets are supported. The tools are native Windows executable which
means they do not need an emulation layer to run once built. The tools
understand and use standard Windows paths and integrate easily into Windows IDE
environments because they understand and use standard Windows paths. Native
Windows tools have proven over time to be stable and reliable with good
performance. If you are a Windows user or you are required to use Windows you
can still develop RTEMS application as easily as a Unix operating system. Some
debugging experiences may vary and if this is an issue please raised the topic
on the RTEMS Users mailing list.

Building the tools or some other packages may require a Unix or POSIX type
shell. There are a few options, Cygwin and MSYS2. I recommend MSYS2.

NOTE: From time to time I provide tools for Windows at
http://ftp.rtems.org/pub/rtems/people/chrisj/source-builder/4.11/mingw32/

MSYS2

This is a new version of the old MinGW project's original MSYS based around the
Arch Linux pacman packager. MSYS and MSYS2 are a specific fork of the Cygwin
project with some fundamental changes in the handling of paths and mounts that
allow easy interaction between the emulated POSIX environment and the native
Windows environment.

Install MSYS2 using the installer you can download from
https://msys2.github.io/. Follow the instructions on the install page and make
sure you remove any global path entries to any other Cygwin, MinGW, MSYS or
packages that may uses a Cygwin DLL, for example some ports of Git.

To build the tools you need install the following packages using pacman:

 $ pacman -S git cvs bison make texinfo patch unzip diffutils tar \
          mingw64/mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc mingw64/mingw-w64-x86_64-binutils

To build make sure you add '--without-python --jobs=none' to the standard RSB
command line. MSYS2 has a temp file name issue and so the GNU AR steps on
itself when running in parallel on SMP hardware which means we have to set the
jobs option to none.

Install a suitable version of Python from http://www.python.org/ and add it to
the start of your path. The MSYS2 python does not work with waf.

Cygwin

Building on Windows is a little more complicated because the Cygwin shell is
used rather than the MSYS2 shell. The MSYS2 shell is simpler because the
detected host triple is MinGW so the build is standard cross-compiler build.
A Canadian cross-build using Cygwin is supported if you would like native tools.

Install a recent Cygwin version using the Cygwin setup tool. Select and install
the groups and packages listed:

|================================

The setup tool will add a number of dependent package and it is ok to accept
them.

I have found turning off Windows Defender improves performance if you have
another up to date virus detection tool installed and enabled. I used the
excellent `Process Hacker 2` tool to monitor the performance and I found the
Windows Defender service contributed a high load. In my case I had a 3rd party
virus tool installed so the Windows Defender service was not needed.

A Canadian cross-compile (Cxc) is required on Cygwin because the host is Cygwin
therefore a traditional cross-compile will result in Cygiwn binaries. With a
Canadian cross-compile a Cygwin cross-compiler is built as well as the MinGW
RTEMS cross-compiler. The Cygwin cross-compiler is required to build the C
runtime for the RTEMS target because we are building under Cygiwn. The build
output for an RTEMS 4.10 ARM tool set is:

CAUTION: Cygwin documents the 'Big List Of Dodgy Apps' or 'BLODA'. The link is
http://cygwin.com/faq/faq.html#faq.using.bloda and it is worth a
look. You will see a large number of common pieces of software found on Windows
systems that can cause problems. My testing has been performed with NOD32
running and I have seen some failures. The list is for all of Cygwin so I am
not sure which of the listed programs effect the RTEMS Source Biulder. The
following FAQ item talks about +fork+ failures and presents some technical
reasons they cannot be avoided in all cases. Cygwin and it's fork MSYS are
fantastic pieces of software in a difficult environment. I have found building
a single tool tends to work, building all at once is harder.

History
-------

The RTEMS Source Builder is a stand alone tool based on another tool called the
'SpecBuilder'. The SpecBuilder was written for the RTEMS project to give me a
way to build tools on hosts that did not support RPMs. At the time the RTEMS
tools maintainer only used spec files to create various packages. This meant I
had either spec files, RPM files or SRPM files. The RPM and SPRM files where
useless because you needed an 'rpm' type tool to extract and manage them. There
are versions of 'rpm' for a number of non-RPM hosts however these proved to be
in various broken states and randomly maintained. The solution I settled on was
to use spec files so I wrote a Python based tool that parsed the spec file
format and allowed me to create a shell script I could run to build the
package. This approach proved successful and I was able to track the RPM
version of the RTEMS tools on a non-RPM host over a number of years. however
the SpecBuilder tool did not help me build tools or other packages not related
to the RTEMS project where there was no spec file I could use so I needed
another tool. Rather than start again I decided to take the parsing code for
the spec file format and build a new tool called the RTEMS Source Builder.
